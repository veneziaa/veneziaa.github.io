Throughout high school my mother was one to push me into the medical field, I never imagined doing anything else because of that. I was very drawn to please her because I lacked attention growing up and tried anything to make her happy, because of that I overlooked my love for computers. I had enrolled into college to do just that and began studying Bioengineering, but sadly I always felt like something lacked as far as passion and 2 years in I had decided to have a talk with my mother and changed my major. During that time, I had begun to get into the fitness industry and decided to switch to kinesiology because it still fell into a category that would make her happy, in my time studying kinesiology I was and ecstatic that I was learning new information that could help me to better my fitness journey. The issue with this was I still lacked a passion for my professional life and knew it wasnâ€™t a field I wanted to pursue. I had taken time off to self-reflect an remembered a digital design class I had taken in high school and remembered the little time our teacher allowed us to work with binary code and with designing games (it was not much) and I remembered how I was always eager to accomplish the tasks he had given us. This was the moment I had rekindled with my passion to work with computers and so I had gotten a book that taught me python. After a few months of that I had come across Flatiron and it felt like a fit worth trying. I love the challenge of creating new things and the idea of seeing something I decide to create come to life is what I am excited to purse.
